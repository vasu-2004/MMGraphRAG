The equation is written in LaTeX-style mathematical notation and reads: \[ \mathrm{CE} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i} \alpha_i \sum_{j \in \{0,1\}} y_{ij} \log p_{ij} \]This formula represents a weighted cross-entropy loss function. Here, \( N \) denotes the total number of samples in the dataset. The outer summation is over individual samples \( i \), and each sample contributes to the loss scaled by a weight factor \( \alpha_i \), where \( \alpha_i \in [0,1] \). This weighting allows for adjusting the importance of different samples, typically to address class imbalance. The inner summation is over the possible class labels \( j \in \{0,1\} \), indicating a binary classification setting. For each sample \( i \) and class \( j \), \( y_{ij} \) is the true label (usually 0 or 1 in one-hot encoding), and \( p_{ij} \) is the predicted probability assigned by the model to class \( j \) for sample \( i \). The logarithmic term \( \log p_{ij} \) penalizes low-confidence correct predictions more heavily. The negative sign ensures that minimizing the CE loss corresponds to maximizing the likelihood of correct predictions. The context provided explains that this formulation allows for unequal treatment of samples via \( \alpha_i \), which can be set based on inverse class frequency or tuned via hyperparameters such as \( K \) in the expression \( \log \left( \frac{n - n_t}{n_t} + K \right) \), where \( n_t \) is the count of samples in class \( t \) and \( n \) is the total number of training samples.

For each instance i, the sum is taken over the two possible class labels j ∈ {0,1}, where y_ij represents the true label (either 0 or 1) and p_ij denotes the predicted probability for class j. The logarithm of the predicted probability is weighted by the true label, ensuring that only the log-probability of the correct class contributes to the loss.

### Initial LLM Response

The paper proposes to calculate the sample weight coefficient **αᵢ** in the Weighted Cross-Entropy (WCE) Loss using a formulation based on **inverse class frequency**, specifically:

$$
\alpha_i = \log\left( \frac{n - n_t}{n_t} + K \right)
$$

Where:
- $ n $ is the total number of samples in the dataset,
- $ n_t $ is the number of samples belonging to the class $ t $ of the i-th sample,
- $ K $ is a tunable hyperparameter that stabilizes the logarithm and prevents extreme weights when $ n_t $ is very small.

This approach assigns **higher weights to samples from minority classes** (i.e., classes with smaller $ n_t $), thereby increasing their contribution to the total loss and helping to mitigate bias caused by class imbalance during training.

This definition of $ \alpha_i $ is explicitly described in the entity **"Sample Weight Coefficient (α_i)"**, which is directly linked to both the **Weighted Cross-Entropy Loss (WCE)** and the mathematical expression shown in **IMAGE_3**. The use of the logarithmic transformation softens the effect of extreme inverse frequencies while still emphasizing rare classes.

### Multimodal Processing (2 images)

**Image**: examples/example_working/images/image_2.jpg
**Response**: ### **Table Analysis**

The provided data includes an entity named **"Sample Weight Coefficient (α_i)"** with the following description:

> *"The weight coefficient $\alpha_i$ is associated with the i-th sample and modulates its contribution to the overall loss in weighted cross-entropy formulations. It is often calculated using the inverse frequency of the sample’s class (e.g., $\log(\frac{n - n_t}{n_t} + K)$, where $n_t$ is the count of class $t$, $n$ is the total number of samples, and $K$ is a tunable hyperparameter). This weighting scheme assigns higher importance to minority-class samples to counteract data imbalance."*

This directly specifies how α_i is computed:
- It uses **inverse class frequency**, specifically:  
  $$
  \alpha_i = \log\left(\frac{n - n_t}{n_t} + K\right)
  $$
  where:
  - $n_t$: number of samples in class $t$,
  - $n$: total number of samples,
  - $K$: a tunable hyperparameter (likely added for numerical stability or to control the magnitude of weights).

Additionally, the relationship between **Weighted Cross-Entropy Loss (WCE)** and **Sample Weight Coefficient (α_i)** confirms that α_i scales the contribution of each sample in the loss function.

---

### **Image Analysis**

Two images are referenced:
- **IMAGE_2**: Displays the standard Cross-Entropy (CE) loss formula:
  $$
  \mathrm{CE} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i} \sum_{j \in \{0,1\}} y_{ij} \log p_{ij}
  $$
  This does not include any weighting term (no α_i), so it represents the baseline unweighted CE.

- **IMAGE_3**: Shows the **Weighted Cross-Entropy Loss** formula:
  $$
  \mathrm{CE} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i} \alpha_i \sum_{j \in \{0,1\}} y_{ij} \log p_{ij}
  $$
  Here, the **weight coefficient α_i** is explicitly included as a multiplicative factor outside the inner summation over classes. This confirms that each sample's contribution to the loss is scaled by α_i.

From IMAGE_3, we can extract:
- The presence of **α_i** in the formula.
- The structure of the weighted version: the outer sum over samples $i$ now includes α_i.
- No explicit calculation of α_i is shown in the image itself, but the context from the table links this to the inverse frequency formula.

---

### **Integrated Insights**

The paper proposes to calculate the coefficient **α_i** using a **class-based weighting scheme** derived from **inverse class frequency**, specifically:

$$
\alpha_i = \log\left(\frac{n - n_t}{n_t} + K\right)
$$

where:
- $n_t$ is the count of samples belonging to the class $t$ of sample $i$,
- $n$ is the total number of training samples,
- $K$ is a tunable hyperparameter to prevent division-by-zero or extreme values.

This formulation ensures:
- **Higher weights** are assigned to samples from **minority classes** (since $n_t$ is small → $\frac{n - n_t}{n_t}$ is large → log value is large),
- **Lower weights** are assigned to samples from **majority classes**,
- Thus, the model is encouraged to pay more attention to underrepresented classes during training.

This approach is implemented in the **Weighted Cross-Entropy Loss (WCE)**, which modifies the standard CE loss by multiplying each sample’s contribution by α_i, as seen in IMAGE_3.

---

### **Conclusion**

The paper proposes calculating the coefficient α_i for the Weighted Cross-Entropy Loss using the formula:

$$
\alpha_i = \log\left(\frac{n - n_t}{n_t} + K\right)
$$

This method adjusts the loss based on class frequency, giving greater importance to minority-class samples to mitigate the effects of class imbalance. The visual evidence from IMAGE_3 confirms the inclusion of α_i in the loss function, while the textual description provides the exact computation rule.

**Image**: examples/example_working/images/image_3.jpg
**Response**: ### Table Analysis

The entity **"Sample Weight Coefficient (α_i)"** is described in the table as follows:

> "The weight coefficient $\alpha_i$ is associated with the i-th sample and modulates its contribution to the overall loss in weighted cross-entropy formulations. It is often calculated using the inverse frequency of the sample’s class (e.g., $\log(\frac{n - n_t}{n_t} + K)$, where $n_t$ is the count of class $t$, $n$ is the total number of samples, and $K$ is a tunable hyperparameter). This weighting scheme assigns higher importance to minority-class samples to counteract data imbalance."

This indicates that the coefficient $\alpha_i$ is computed based on the **inverse class frequency**, specifically using the formula:
$$
\alpha_i = \log\left(\frac{n - n_t}{n_t} + K\right)
$$
where:
- $n_t$: number of samples in class $t$,
- $n$: total number of samples,
- $K$: a tunable hyperparameter.

This formulation ensures that **minority classes receive higher weights**, thereby mitigating bias caused by class imbalance.

---

### Image Analysis

The image labeled **IMAGE_3** contains the following mathematical expression:
$$
\mathrm{CE} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i} \alpha_i \sum_{j \in \{0,1\}} y_{ij} \log p_{ij}
$$
This confirms the presence of the **weighting factor $\alpha_i$** in the cross-entropy loss function. The description of IMAGE_3 further clarifies:
> "The context provided explains that this formulation allows for unequal treatment of samples via $\alpha_i$, which can be set based on inverse class frequency or tuned via hyperparameters such as $K$ in the expression $\log \left( \frac{n - n_t}{n_t} + K \right)$..."

Thus, the image reinforces the idea that $\alpha_i$ is derived from **inverse class frequency**, with an added hyperparameter $K$ for tuning.

---

### Integrated Insights

Combining information from both the **table** and **image**, we conclude:

- The paper proposes calculating the coefficient $\alpha_i$ using:
  $$
  \alpha_i = \log\left(\frac{n - n_t}{n_t} + K\right)
  $$
  where $n_t$ is the count of samples in class $t$, $n$ is the total number of samples, and $K$ is a tunable hyperparameter.
- This approach emphasizes **minority-class samples** by assigning them higher weights, thus addressing **class imbalance**.
- The use of $K$ allows for **fine-tuning** the weight scaling, preventing overfitting to rare classes.
- The inclusion of $\alpha_i$ in the loss function (as shown in IMAGE_3) modifies the standard cross-entropy loss into a **weighted version**, enabling more balanced training across classes.

This method is consistent with common practices in handling imbalanced datasets in machine learning, particularly in NLP and classification tasks.

### Merged Multimodal Response

The paper proposes to calculate the coefficient αᵢ for the Weighted Cross-Entropy Loss using a class-based inverse frequency weighting scheme. Specifically, the formula is:

\[
\alpha_i = \log\left(\frac{n - n_t}{n_t} + K\right)
\]

where:  
- \(n_t\) is the number of samples in class \(t\) (the class of the i-th sample),  
- \(n\) is the total number of training samples,  
- \(K\) is a tunable hyperparameter added for numerical stability and to control the magnitude of the weights.

This formulation assigns higher weights to samples from minority classes (where \(n_t\) is small), thereby increasing their contribution to the loss and helping to mitigate class imbalance during training. The use of this αᵢ is explicitly incorporated into the loss function as shown in the weighted cross-entropy expression:

\[
\mathrm{WCE} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i} \alpha_i \sum_{j \in \{0,1\}} y_{ij} \log p_{ij}
\]

Thus, the paper combines inverse class frequency with a logarithmic transformation and a tunable offset \(K\) to compute sample-specific weights that promote balanced learning across imbalanced classes.

### Final Response

The paper proposes to calculate the coefficient αᵢ for the Weighted Cross-Entropy Loss using a **class-based inverse frequency weighting scheme** with a logarithmic transformation. Specifically, the formula is:

\[
\alpha_i = \log\left(\frac{n - n_t}{n_t} + K\right)
\]

where:  
- \(n_t\) is the number of samples in class \(t\) (the class of the i-th sample),  
- \(n\) is the total number of training samples,  
- \(K\) is a tunable hyperparameter added for numerical stability and to control the magnitude of the weights.

This formulation assigns **higher weights to samples from minority classes** (where \(n_t\) is small), thereby increasing their contribution to the loss and helping to mitigate class imbalance during training. The coefficient αᵢ is incorporated into the weighted cross-entropy loss as:

\[
\mathrm{WCE} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i} \alpha_i \sum_{j \in \{0,1\}} y_{ij} \log p_{ij}
\]

The use of the logarithm softens extreme weight values while still emphasizing rare classes, and the hyperparameter \(K\) prevents division-by-zero or excessively large weights when \(n_t\) is very small.

# 5.3 Hyper-parameters in Tversky Index

As mentioned in Section 3.3, Tversky index (TI) offers the flexibility in controlling the tradeoff between false-negatives and false-positives. In this subsection, we explore the effect of hyperparameters (i.e., $\alpha$ and $\beta$ ) in TI to test how they manipulate the tradeoff. We conduct experiments on the Chinese OntoNotes4.0 NER dataset and English QuoRef MRC dataset. Experimental results are shown in Table 10. The highest F1 on Chinese OntoNotes4.0 is 84.67 when $\alpha$ is set to 0.6 while for QuoRef, the highest F1 is 68.44 when $\alpha$ is set to 0.4. In addition, we can observe that the performance varies a lot as $\alpha$ changes in distinct datasets, which shows that the hyperparameters $\alpha , \beta$ acturally play an important role in TI.

# 6 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose the dice-based loss to narrow down the gap between training objective and evaluation metrics (F1 score). Experimental results show that the proposed loss function help

We use three datasets on this task: SQuAD v1.1, SQuAD v2.0 (Rajpurkar et al., 2016, 2018) and Quoref (Dasigi et al., 2019).

Baselines We used the following baselines:

• QANet: Yu et al. (2018b) builds a model based on convolutions and self-attentions. Convolutions are used to model local interactions and self-attention are used to model global interactions. BERT: Devlin et al. (2018) scores each candidate span and the maximum scoring span is used as a prediction.   
• XLNet: Yang et al. (2019) proposes a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that

# A Dataset Details

# A.1 Part-of-Speech Tagging

Datasets We conduct experiments on three widely used benchmark, i.e., Chinese Treebank $5 . 0 ^ { 2 } / 6 . 0 ^ { 3 }$ and $\mathrm { U D } 1 . 4 ^ { 4 }$ .

• CTB5 is a Chinese dataset for tagging and parsing, which contains 507,222 words, 824,983 characters and 18,782 sentences extracted from newswire sources, including 698 articles from Xinhua (1994-1998), 55 articles from Information Services Department of HKSAR (1997) and 132 articles from Sinorama Magazine (1996-1998 & 2000-2001).

• CTB6 is an extension of CTB5, containing 781,351 words, 1,285,149 characters and 28,295 sentences.

• UD is the abbreviation of Universal Dependencies, which is a framework for consistent annotation of grammar (parts of speech, morphological features, and syntactic dependencies) across different human languages. In this work, we use UD1.4 for Chinese POS tagging.

# A.2 Named Entity Recognition

Datasets For the NER task, we consider both Chinese datasets, i.e., OntoNotes $4 . 0 ^ { 5 }$ and MSRA6 , and English datasets, i.e., CoNLL2003 7 and OntoNote $5 . 0 ^ { 8 }$ .

• CoNLL2003 is an English dataset with 4 entity types: Location, Organization, Person and Miscellaneous. We followed data processing protocols in (Ma and Hovy, 2016).

• English OntoNotes5.0 consists of texts from a wide variety of sources and contains 18 entity types. We use the standard train/dev/test split of CoNLL2012 shared task.

• Chinese MSRA performs as a Chinese benchmark dataset containing 3 entity types. Data in MSRA is collected from news domain. Since the development set is not provided in the original MSRA dataset, we randomly split the training set into training and development splits by 9:1. We use the official test set for evaluation.

• Chinese OntoNotes4.0 is a Chinese dataset and consists of texts from news domain, which has 18 entity types. In this paper, we take the same data split as Wu et al. (2019) did.

# A.3 Machine Reading Comprephension

Datasets For MRC task, we use three datasets: $\mathrm { S Q u A D v 1 . 1 / v 2 . 0 ^ { 9 } }$ and Queref10 datasets.

• SQuAD v1.1 and SQuAD $\mathbf { v } 2 . \mathbf { 0 }$ are the most widely used QA benchmarks. SQuAD1.1 is a collection of 100K crowdsourced question-answer pairs, and SQuAD2.0 extends SQuAD1.1 allowing no short answer exists in the provided passage.

• Quoref is a QA dataset which tests the coreferential reasoning capability of reading comprehension systems, containing 24K questions over 4.7K paragraphs from Wikipedia.

# A.4 Paraphrase Identification

Datasets Experiments are conducted on two PI datasets: $\mathbf { M R P C } ^ { 1 1 }$ and $\mathrm { Q Q P ^ { 1 2 } }$ .

• MRPC is a corpus of sentence pairs automatically extracted from online news sources, with human annotations of whether the sentence pairs are semantically equivalent. The MRPC dataset has imbalanced classes (6800 pairs in total, and $68 \%$ for positive, $32 \%$ for negative).

QQP is a collection of question pairs from the community question-answering website Quora. The class distribution in QQP is also unbalanced (over 400,000 question pairs in total, and $37 \%$ for positive, $63 \%$ for negative)."
    ```
    

### Initial LLM Response

The **OntoNotes4.0 dataset** itself is **not exclusively Chinese or English**—it is a **multilingual corpus** that includes data in multiple languages, including **both English and Chinese**. However, in the context of the provided data:

- The entry **"CHINESE ONTONOTES4.0"** (and its variants like "CHINESE ONTONOTES4.0 NER DATASET") explicitly refers to the **Chinese-language portion** of the OntoNotes 4.0 corpus.
- This Chinese subset is used specifically for **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** tasks in several experiments cited, such as those involving BERT-MRC, Lattice-LSTM, and Tversky Index hyperparameter tuning.
- The description clarifies: *"Chinese OntoNotes4.0 is a named entity recognition dataset consisting of news-domain texts with 18 entity types"* and that it is the **Chinese version** of the OntoNotes corpus.

Meanwhile:
- There is also an **English OntoNotes5.0** mentioned in the sources (used alongside CoNLL2003), but **OntoNotes4.0 in this context predominantly refers to the Chinese variant** when discussed in relation to NER experiments in the provided tables and text.

### Conclusion:
In the specific context of the provided data and experiments, **OntoNotes4.0 is used as a Chinese Named Entity Recognition dataset**. The broader OntoNotes 4.0 corpus includes multiple languages, but the referenced usage here is **Chinese**.

### Initial LLM Response

Based on the provided data:

- The **XLNet+DSC** model variant achieves an **F1 score of 72.90 on the QuoRef dataset**, which represents an **improvement of +1.41** over the base **XLNet** model.

No other XLNet variants or their corresponding improvements on QuoRef are mentioned in the data tables. Therefore, **XLNet+DSC** is the only documented variant with a reported improvement on QuoRef, and it has the **highest (and only specified) improvement of +1.41 F1 points** compared to the base XLNet model.

### Commentary:
- The improvement stems from applying **Discriminative Self-Consistency (DSC)** to the XLNet architecture.
- DSC appears to be particularly effective on challenging datasets like QuoRef, which involves complex reasoning in machine reading comprehension.
- Since no other XLNet-based variants (e.g., XLNet+FL, XLNet+DL) are reported for QuoRef in the provided data, **XLNet+DSC stands as the top-performing variant by default** within the available evidence.

### Multimodal Processing (1 images)

**Image**: examples/example_working/images/image_21.jpg
**Response**: **Table Analysis**

The provided table (referred to as **IMAGE_21**, corresponding to **Table 8**) contains F1-score results for the **QQP dataset**, not the **QuoRef dataset**. It compares four model variants—BERT, BERT+FL, BERT+DL, and BERT+DSC—under various data augmentation strategies: original, +positive, +negative, -negative, and +positive & negative.

Key observations from this table:
- The **BERT+DSC** variant achieves the highest F1 score (**93.63**) under the "+ positive & negative" augmentation strategy.
- Relative improvements over the base BERT model are shown in parentheses (e.g., BERT+DSC improves by +0.81 in the original setting).
- However, this table is specific to the **QQP dataset**, not QuoRef.

**Image Analysis**

The image content confirms that it is **Table 8**, which focuses on **QQP** and does not include any data related to the **QuoRef** dataset. Therefore, no relevant information about QuoRef can be extracted from this image.

From the entity list:
- **XLNet+DSC** is mentioned as achieving high performance on multiple datasets, including **QuoRef**, with an F1 score of **72.90**, representing a **+1.41 improvement** over the base XLNet model.
- This information comes from the description of **XLNet+DSC** in the entities, which explicitly states its performance gains across tasks, including QuoRef.

**Integrated Insights**

To answer the query: *"Which model variant has the highest improvement in F1 score for the QuoRef dataset when compared to the base XLNet model?"*

- The **QuoRef dataset** is not present in **Table 8** (IMAGE_21), so this table cannot be used directly.
- However, the **entity description for XLNet+DSC** provides explicit information about performance on QuoRef: it reports an F1 score of **72.90**, which is **+1.41 higher** than the base XLNet model.
- No other XLNet variants are mentioned in the context of QuoRef, and no other models are reported with comparable improvements on this dataset in the provided data.

**Conclusion**

Based on the available information:

> The **XLNet+DSC** model variant has the highest improvement in F1 score for the **QuoRef dataset**, achieving a **+1.41 increase** over the base XLNet model.

This conclusion relies on the **entity description** of **XLNet+DSC**, not on the table or image, since the table pertains to QQP, not QuoRef.

We can see that $^ +$ positive outperforms original, and +negative underperforms original. This is in line with our expectation since $^ +$ positive creates a balanced dataset while +negative creates a more imbalanced dataset. Despite the fact that -negative creates a balanced dataset, the number of training data decreases, resulting in inferior performances.

DSC achieves the highest F1 score across all datasets. Specially, for $^ +$ positive, DSC achieves minor improvements $\left( + 0 . 0 5 \mathrm { F 1 } \right.$ ) over DL. In contrast, it significantly outperforms DL for $^ +$ negative dataset. This is in line with our expectation since DSC helps more on more imbalanced datasets. The performance of FL and DL are not consistent across different datasets, while DSC consistently performs the best on all datasets.

# 5.2 Dice loss for accuracy-oriented tasks?

We argue that the cross-entropy objective is actually accuracy-oriented, whereas the proposed losses perform as a soft version of F1 score. To explore the effect of the dice loss on accuracyoriented tasks such as text classification, we conduct experiments on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) datasets including SST-2 and SST-5. We fine-tuned $\mathrm { B E R T _ { L a r g e } }$ with different training objectives. Experimental results for SST are shown in Table 9. For SST-5, BERT with CE achieves 55.57 in terms of accuracy, while DL and DSC perform slightly worse (54.63 and 55.19, respectively). Similar phenomenon is observed for SST-2. These results verify that the proposed dice loss is not accuracy-oriented, and should not be used for accuracy-oriented tasks.

### Initial LLM Response

According to **Table 8**, the data augmentation method that resulted in the **highest F1-score for the base BERT model** was:

### **"+ positive & negative"**

- **F1-score**: **93.14**
- This represents an improvement of **+1.84** over the original BERT score of **91.30**.

### Commentary:
The "+ positive & negative" strategy involved augmenting the original training data with **both additional positive and negative examples**, while maintaining a **balanced class distribution (50% positive, 50% negative)**. This contrasts with other methods:
- **"+ positive"** also improved performance (92.27), but less than the combined approach.
- **"+ negative"** degraded performance (90.08), likely due to increased class imbalance (21% positive, 79% negative).
- **"- negative"** (downsampling negatives to balance classes) reduced overall data size and led to worse performance (89.73).

Thus, **combining both positive and negative augmentations** yielded optimal results for BERT on the QQP dataset in terms of F1-score.

### Multimodal Processing (1 images)

**Image**: examples/example_working/images/image_21.jpg
**Response**: ### Table Analysis

The provided table, identified as **Table 8**, presents the F1-scores of various BERT-based models under different data augmentation strategies on the Quora Question Pairs (QQP) dataset. The augmentation methods evaluated are:

- **original**: No augmentation.
- **+ positive**: Augmentation with additional positive examples.
- **+ negative**: Augmentation with additional negative examples.
- **- negative**: Downsampling of negative examples to balance the dataset.
- **+ positive & negative**: Augmentation with both positive and negative examples.

For the **BERT** model (first row), the F1-scores across these conditions are:
- **original**: 91.3
- **+ positive**: 92.27
- **+ negative**: 90.08
- **- negative**: 89.73
- **+ positive & negative**: **93.14**

Among these, the highest F1-score is **93.14**, achieved under the **+ positive & negative** augmentation method.

### Image Analysis

The image (`IMAGE_21`) corresponds directly to **Table 8**, as confirmed by the relationship `IMAGE_21 → TABLE 8`. The visual content of the image includes the same tabular data described above, with clear labeling of columns and rows. The values in the image match those in the provided table, confirming its accuracy and relevance.

Additionally, the image contains textual annotations describing the data augmentation techniques:
- **+ positive**: Adds positive examples, resulting in a balanced dataset (50% positive, 50% negative).
- **+ negative**: Adds negative examples, creating an imbalanced dataset (21% positive, 79% negative).
- **- negative**: Removes negative examples via downsampling to achieve balance (50% each).
- **+ positive & negative**: Combines both types of augmentation while maintaining the original class distribution.

These descriptions support the interpretation that **+ positive & negative** combines the benefits of both augmentations without introducing imbalance or reducing data size.

### Integrated Insights

The **+ positive & negative** augmentation strategy consistently yields the highest F1-score for all BERT variants, including the base BERT model. For BERT specifically, this method results in a **93.14 F1-score**, which is **1.84 points higher** than the original baseline (91.3). This improvement surpasses all other augmentation methods, including **+ positive** (92.27) and **+ negative** (90.08).

Moreover, the **+ negative** method degrades performance due to severe class imbalance, while **- negative** reduces training data volume despite balancing classes, leading to suboptimal results. In contrast, **+ positive & negative** maintains balanced class distribution and increases training data size, enabling better generalization.

### Conclusion

According to **Table 8** (and its corresponding image `IMAGE_21`), the **+ positive & negative** data augmentation method resulted in the **highest F1-score (93.14)** for the **BERT model**. This strategy outperforms all others by effectively leveraging both positive and negative examples without introducing imbalance or data loss.

### Merged Multimodal Response

According to Table 8, the **+ positive & negative** data augmentation method resulted in the highest F1-score for the BERT model, achieving a score of **93.14**. This approach combines both positive and negative example augmentation while preserving the original class distribution, leading to improved performance compared to other methods.

### Final Response

According to Table 8, the data augmentation method that resulted in the highest F1-score for the BERT model was **"+ positive & negative"**, achieving an F1-score of **93.14**. This approach augmented the training data with both additional positive and negative examples while maintaining a balanced class distribution (50% positive, 50% negative), leading to the best performance among all tested methods.

# 5.3 Hyper-parameters in Tversky Index

As mentioned in Section 3.3, Tversky index (TI) offers the flexibility in controlling the tradeoff between false-negatives and false-positives. In this subsection, we explore the effect of hyperparameters (i.e., $\alpha$ and $\beta$ ) in TI to test how they manipulate the tradeoff. We conduct experiments on the Chinese OntoNotes4.0 NER dataset and English QuoRef MRC dataset. Experimental results are shown in Table 10. The highest F1 on Chinese OntoNotes4.0 is 84.67 when $\alpha$ is set to 0.6 while for QuoRef, the highest F1 is 68.44 when $\alpha$ is set to 0.4. In addition, we can observe that the performance varies a lot as $\alpha$ changes in distinct datasets, which shows that the hyperparameters $\alpha , \beta$ acturally play an important role in TI.

# 6 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose the dice-based loss to narrow down the gap between training objective and evaluation metrics (F1 score). Experimental results show that the proposed loss function help

# A Dataset Details

# A.1 Part-of-Speech Tagging

Datasets We conduct experiments on three widely used benchmark, i.e., Chinese Treebank $5 . 0 ^ { 2 } / 6 . 0 ^ { 3 }$ and $\mathrm { U D } 1 . 4 ^ { 4 }$ .

• CTB5 is a Chinese dataset for tagging and parsing, which contains 507,222 words, 824,983 characters and 18,782 sentences extracted from newswire sources, including 698 articles from Xinhua (1994-1998), 55 articles from Information Services Department of HKSAR (1997) and 132 articles from Sinorama Magazine (1996-1998 & 2000-2001).

• CTB6 is an extension of CTB5, containing 781,351 words, 1,285,149 characters and 28,295 sentences.

• UD is the abbreviation of Universal Dependencies, which is a framework for consistent annotation of grammar (parts of speech, morphological features, and syntactic dependencies) across different human languages. In this work, we use UD1.4 for Chinese POS tagging.

# A.2 Named Entity Recognition

Datasets For the NER task, we consider both Chinese datasets, i.e., OntoNotes $4 . 0 ^ { 5 }$ and MSRA6 , and English datasets, i.e., CoNLL2003 7 and OntoNote $5 . 0 ^ { 8 }$ .

• CoNLL2003 is an English dataset with 4 entity types: Location, Organization, Person and Miscellaneous. We followed data processing protocols in (Ma and Hovy, 2016).

• English OntoNotes5.0 consists of texts from a wide variety of sources and contains 18 entity types. We use the standard train/dev/test split of CoNLL2012 shared task.

• Chinese MSRA performs as a Chinese benchmark dataset containing 3 entity types. Data in MSRA is collected from news domain. Since the development set is not provided in the original MSRA dataset, we randomly split the training set into training and development splits by 9:1. We use the official test set for evaluation.

• Chinese OntoNotes4.0 is a Chinese dataset and consists of texts from news domain, which has 18 entity types. In this paper, we take the same data split as Wu et al. (2019) did.

# A.3 Machine Reading Comprephension

Datasets For MRC task, we use three datasets: $\mathrm { S Q u A D v 1 . 1 / v 2 . 0 ^ { 9 } }$ and Queref10 datasets.

• SQuAD v1.1 and SQuAD $\mathbf { v } 2 . \mathbf { 0 }$ are the most widely used QA benchmarks. SQuAD1.1 is a collection of 100K crowdsourced question-answer pairs, and SQuAD2.0 extends SQuAD1.1 allowing no short answer exists in the provided passage.

• Quoref is a QA dataset which tests the coreferential reasoning capability of reading comprehension systems, containing 24K questions over 4.7K paragraphs from Wikipedia.

# A.4 Paraphrase Identification

Datasets Experiments are conducted on two PI datasets: $\mathbf { M R P C } ^ { 1 1 }$ and $\mathrm { Q Q P ^ { 1 2 } }$ .

• MRPC is a corpus of sentence pairs automatically extracted from online news sources, with human annotations of whether the sentence pairs are semantically equivalent. The MRPC dataset has imbalanced classes (6800 pairs in total, and $68 \%$ for positive, $32 \%$ for negative).

QQP is a collection of question pairs from the community question-answering website Quora. The class distribution in QQP is also unbalanced (over 400,000 question pairs in total, and $37 \%$ for positive, $63 \%$ for negative)."
    ```
    

### Initial LLM Response

According to **Table 10**, the **highest F1 score** achieved on the **Chinese OntoNotes4.0 NER dataset** is **84.67**, which occurs when the Tversky Index hyperparameter **α = 0.6**.

This result is part of an experiment evaluating the effect of the α hyperparameter in the Tversky Index (with β set to 1 − α). The scores across different α values show that performance peaks at α = 0.6 for this dataset, highlighting the sensitivity of model performance to the choice of α in imbalanced learning scenarios such as named entity recognition.

### Initial LLM Response

### Highest F1 Score on the English WSJ Dataset

Based on **Table 4** from the provided data (as referenced in the *Sources* and linked via relationships to *"BOHNET ET AL., 2018"* and various model entries), the **English WSJ dataset** results include the following models and their F1 scores:

| Model                              | F1 Score |
|-----------------------------------|----------|
| Meta BiLSTM (Bohnet et al., 2018) | 98.23    |
| BERT-Tagger (Devlin et al., 2018) | 98.86    |
| BERT-Tagger + FL                  | 98.88 (+0.02) |
| BERT-Tagger + DL                  | 98.91 (+0.05) |
| **BERT-Tagger + DSC**             | **99.38 (+0.52)** |

> **Note**: The values in parentheses (e.g., +0.52) indicate absolute improvement over the baseline BERT-Tagger.

### Conclusion

The **BERT-Tagger + DSC** model achieved the **highest F1 score of 99.38** on the English WSJ dataset, outperforming all other listed models, including the original BERT-Tagger and the Meta BiLSTM by Bohnet et al. (2018).

This result highlights the effectiveness of incorporating the **Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC)** as a loss function (or optimization target), which—given its equivalence to the F1 score—directly optimizes for this evaluation metric.

2,"IMAGE_20","ORI_IMG",""The image is a table labeled 'Table 7: Experimental results for PI task.' It presents performance comparisons of various models on two natural language understanding benchmarks: MRPC (Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus) and QQP (Quora Question Pairs). The table has three columns: 'Model', 'MRPC F1', and 'QQP F1'. Each row corresponds to a model configuration, with the base models being BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and XLNet (Yang et al., 2019), followed by their variants enhanced with different techniques: FL (Focal Loss), DL (Denoising Loss), and DSC (Dual Soft Constraint loss).The first section lists BERT-based models. BERT achieves an F1 score of 88.0 on MRPC and 91.3 on QQP. Adding FL improves the scores to 88.43 (+0.43) and 91.86 (+0.56), respectively. BERT+DL yields 88.71 (+0.71) and 91.92 (+0.62). The best-performing BERT variant is BERT+DSC, achieving 88.92 (+0.92) on MRPC and 92.11 (+0.81) on QQP.The second section presents XLNet-based models. XLNet alone achieves 89.2 on MRPC and 91.8 on QQP. With FL, it improves to 89.25 (+0.05) and 92.31 (+0.51). XLNet+DL reaches 89.33 (+0.13) and 92.39 (+0.59). The top-performing model in this group is XLNet+DSC, scoring 89.78 (+0.58) on MRPC and 92.60 (+0.79) on QQP.All values are presented in black text on a white background, with clear horizontal lines separating rows. The table uses bold formatting for the highest scores in each column (BERT+DSC and XLNet+DSC). The improvement values in parentheses indicate absolute gains over the base model.

# 4.2 Named Entity Recognition

Settings Named entity recognition (NER) is the task of detecting the span and semantic category of entities within a chunk of text. Our implementation uses the current state-of-the-art model proposed by Li et al. (2019) as the backbone, and changes the MLE loss to DSC loss. Datasets that we use include OntoNotes4.0 (Pradhan et al., 2011), MSRA (Levow, 2006), CoNLL2003 (Sang and Meulder, 2003) and OntoNotes5.0 (Pradhan et al., 2013). We report span-level micro-averaged precision, recall and F1.

Baselines We use the following baselines:

• ELMo: a tagging model with pretraining from Peters et al. (2018).   
• Lattice-LSTM: Zhang and Yang (2018) constructs a word-character lattice, only used in Chinese datasets.   
CVT: Clark et al. (2018) uses Cross-View Training(CVT) to improve the representations of a Bi-LSTM encoder.   
• Bert-Tagger: Devlin et"

# • Negative downsampling (- negative)

We down-sampled negative examples in the original training set to get a balanced training set. The down-sampled set contains 269,165 examples, with $50 \%$ being positive and $50 \%$ being negative.

# • Positive and negative augmentation $^ +$ positive $\pmb { \& }$ +negative)

We augmented the original training data with additional positive and negative examples with the data distribution staying the same. The augmented dataset contains 458,477 examples, with $50 \%$ being positive and $50 \%$ being negative.

Results are shown in Table 8. We first look at the first line, with all results obtained using the MLE objective. We can see that $^ +$ positive outperforms original, and +negative underperforms original. This is in line with our expectation since $^ +$ positive creates a balanced dataset while +negative creates a more imbalanced dataset. Despite the fact that -negative creates a balanced dataset, the number of training data decreases, resulting in inferior performances.

DSC achieves the highest F1 score across all datasets. Specially, for $^ +$ positive, DSC achieves minor improvements $\left( + 0 . 0 5 \mathrm { F 1 } \right.$ ) over DL. In contrast, it significantly outperforms DL for $^ +$ negative dataset. This is in line with our expectation since DSC helps more on more imbalanced datasets. The performance of FL and DL are not consistent across different datasets, while DSC consistently performs the best on all datasets.

# 5.2 Dice loss for accuracy-oriented tasks?

We argue that the cross-entropy objective is actually accuracy-oriented, whereas the proposed losses perform as a soft version of F1 score. To explore the effect of the dice loss on accuracyoriented tasks such as text classification, we conduct experiments on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) datasets including SST-2 and SST-5. We fine-tuned $\mathrm { B E R T _ { L a r g e } }$ with different training objectives. Experimental results for SST are shown in Table 9. For SST-5, BERT with CE achieves 55.57 in terms of accuracy, while DL and DSC perform slightly worse (54.63 and 55.19, respectively). Similar phenomenon is observed for SST-2. These results verify that the proposed dice loss is not accuracy-oriented, and should not be used for accuracy-oriented tasks.

# 5.3 Hyper-parameters in Tversky Index

As mentioned in Section 3.3, Tversky index (TI) offers the flexibility in controlling the tradeoff between false-negatives and false-positives. In this subsection, we explore the effect of hyperparameters (i.e., $\alpha$ and $\beta$ ) in TI to test how they manipulate the tradeoff. We conduct experiments on the Chinese OntoNotes4.0 NER dataset and English QuoRef MRC dataset. Experimental results are shown in Table 10. The highest F1 on Chinese OntoNotes4.0 is 84.67 when $\alpha$ is set to 0.6 while for QuoRef, the highest F1 is 68.44 when $\alpha$ is set to 0.4. In addition, we can observe that the performance varies a lot as $\alpha$ changes in distinct datasets, which shows that the hyperparameters $\alpha , \beta$ acturally play an important role in TI.

# 6 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose the dice-based loss to narrow down the gap between training objective and evaluation metrics (F1 score). Experimental results show that the proposed loss function help

### Initial LLM Response

### Performance Comparison: BERT+DL vs. BERT+DSC on SST-5

According to **Table 9**, which evaluates different BERT-based models on the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)** datasets using **accuracy** as the metric:

- **BERT+DL** achieves an accuracy of **54.63%** on **SST-5**.
- **BERT+DSC** achieves an accuracy of **55.19%** on **SST-5**.

### Interpretation

- **BERT+DSC outperforms BERT+DL** on SST-5 by **0.56 percentage points** (55.19 – 54.63 = 0.56).
- However, **both models underperform compared to BERT+CE** (Cross-Entropy), which achieves **55.57%** accuracy—the highest among the three.
- This aligns with the paper's observation that **dice-based losses (DL and DSC)** are designed to optimize **F1-score-like objectives**, not accuracy. Hence, they perform slightly worse than CE on **accuracy-oriented tasks** like SST sentiment classification.

### Summary

> On SST-5, **BERT+DSC (55.19%) performs better than BERT+DL (54.63%)**, but both are marginally inferior to the standard **BERT+CE (55.57%)** baseline in terms of accuracy.

### Multimodal Processing (1 images)

**Image**: examples/example_working/images/image_22.jpg
**Response**: ### Table Analysis

The provided table (Table 9) presents the performance of three BERT-based models—BERT+CE, BERT+DL, and BERT+DSC—on two versions of the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) datasets: SST-2 and SST-5. The metric used is accuracy (Acc).

For **SST-5**, the accuracy values are as follows:
- **BERT+DL**: 54.63%
- **BERT+DSC**: 55.19%

This indicates that **BERT+DSC outperforms BERT+DL** on the SST-5 dataset by a margin of **0.56 percentage points**.

### Image Analysis

The image labeled "IMAGE_22" contains the same table (Table 9) described above. It explicitly shows the accuracy scores for each model on both SST-2 and SST-5. The visual presentation confirms the numerical data from the table, with **bold formatting highlighting the highest accuracy in each column**. In the SST-5 column, **BERT+CE** has the highest accuracy (55.57%), followed by **BERT+DSC** (55.19%) and then **BERT+DL** (54.63%). This visual emphasis reinforces the ranking of performance across models.

### Integrated Insights

Based on the combined analysis of the table and image:
- **BERT+DSC achieves higher accuracy than BERT+DL on SST-5**, with scores of 55.19% versus 54.63%, respectively.
- While both models use dice-based losses (DL and DSC), **DSC performs better than DL** in this accuracy-oriented task.
- The source text further supports this observation, stating that “the proposed dice loss is not accuracy-oriented,” and that **DSC performs slightly better than DL** on SST-5, though both fall short of BERT+CE.

Thus, **BERT+DSC outperforms BERT+DL on SST-5**, demonstrating a modest but consistent advantage in accuracy.

### Merged Multimodal Response

BERT+DSC outperforms BERT+DL on the SST-5 dataset. Specifically, BERT+DSC achieves an accuracy of **55.19%**, while BERT+DL achieves **54.63%**, giving BERT+DSC a **0.56 percentage point advantage**. Although both models use dice-based loss functions, DSC (Dice Similarity Coefficient) demonstrates slightly better performance than DL (Dice Loss) in this accuracy-oriented evaluation. Notably, neither model surpasses BERT+CE, which attains the highest accuracy on SST-5 at **55.57%**.

### Final Response

On the SST-5 dataset, **BERT+DSC outperforms BERT+DL** in terms of accuracy:

- **BERT+DL** achieves an accuracy of **54.63%**  
- **BERT+DSC** achieves an accuracy of **55.19%**

This represents a **0.56 percentage point improvement** for BERT+DSC over BERT+DL. However, both models are slightly outperformed by **BERT+CE**, which reaches **55.57%** accuracy—the highest among the three. The relatively lower performance of dice-based losses (DL and DSC) compared to cross-entropy (CE) is consistent with their design objective: optimizing F1-score-like metrics rather than accuracy.

We down-sampled negative examples in the original training set to get a balanced training set. The down-sampled set contains 269,165 examples, with $50 \%$ being positive and $50 \%$ being negative.

We augmented the original training data with additional positive and negative examples with the data distribution staying the same. The augmented dataset contains 458,477 examples, with $50 \%$ being positive and $50 \%$ being negative.

Results are shown in Table 8. We first look at the first line, with all results obtained using the MLE objective. We can see that $^ +$ positive outperforms original, and +negative underperforms original. This is in line with our expectation since $^ +$ positive creates a balanced dataset while +negative creates a more imbalanced dataset. Despite the fact that -negative creates a balanced dataset, the number of training data decreases, resulting in inferior performances.

DSC achieves the highest F1 score across all datasets. Specially, for $^ +$ positive, DSC achieves minor improvements $\left( + 0 . 0 5 \mathrm { F 1 } \right.$ ) over DL. In contrast, it significantly outperforms DL for $^ +$ negative dataset. This is in line with our expectation since DSC helps more on more imbalanced datasets. The performance of FL and DL are not consistent across different datasets, while DSC consistently performs the best on all datasets.

# 5.2 Dice loss for accuracy-oriented tasks?

We argue that the cross-entropy objective is actually accuracy-oriented, whereas the proposed losses perform as a soft version of F1 score. To explore the effect of the dice loss on accuracyoriented tasks such as text classification, we conduct experiments on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) datasets including SST-2 and SST-5. We fine-tuned $\mathrm { B E R T _ { L a r g e } }$ with different training objectives. Experimental results for SST are shown in Table 9. For SST-5, BERT with CE achieves 55.57 in terms of accuracy, while DL and DSC perform slightly worse (54.63 and 55.19, respectively). Similar phenomenon is observed for SST-2. These results verify that the proposed dice loss is not accuracy-oriented, and should not be used for accuracy-oriented tasks.

### Initial LLM Response

The accuracy of **BERT+CE** on **SST-2** is **94.90%**, while that of **BERT+DL** is **94.37%**.

To compute the difference:

$$
94.90 - 94.37 = 0.53

- **BERT+CE** achieves an accuracy of **94.90%**.
- **BERT+DL** achieves an accuracy of **94.37%**.

To calculate how much the accuracy of BERT+CE exceeds that of BERT+DL on SST-2:

$$
94.90 - 94.37 = 0.53
$$

Thus, BERT+CE outperforms BERT+DL by **0.53 percentage points** on SST-2.

### Image Analysis

The image (IMAGE_22) corresponds directly to Table 9, as confirmed by the relationship:
- `"IMAGE_22" → "TABLE 9"` with a weight of 10.0, indicating a strong association.

The image contains the same tabular data as described above, including bold formatting to emphasize the highest accuracy values (94.90 and 55.57), which aligns with the description in the entities. This visual confirmation supports the accuracy values used in the calculation.

### Integrated Insights

The difference in performance between BERT+CE and BERT+DL on SST-2 is consistent across both the textual description and the visual representation in IMAGE_22. The result highlights that cross-entropy (CE) loss leads to slightly higher accuracy than distillation loss (DL) in this task, supporting the conclusion that CE is more effective for accuracy-oriented tasks like sentiment classification.

### Final Answer

# Abstract

Many NLP tasks such as tagging and machine reading comprehension (MRC) are faced with the severe data imbalance issue: negative examples significantly outnumber positive ones, and the huge number of easy-negative examples overwhelms training. The most commonly used cross entropy criteria is actually accuracy-oriented, which creates a discrepancy between training and test. At training time, each training instance contributes equally to the objective function, while at test time F1 score concerns more about positive examples.

In this paper, we propose to use dice loss in replacement of the standard cross-entropy objective for data-imbalanced NLP tasks. Dice loss is based on the Sørensen–Dice coefficient (Sorensen, 1948) or Tversky index (Tversky, 1977), which attaches similar importance to false positives and false negatives, and is more immune to the data-imbalance issue. To further alleviate the dominating influence from easy-negative examples in training, we propose to associate training examples with dynamically adjusted weights to deemphasize easy-negative examples. Experimental results show that this strategy narrows down the gap between the F1 score in evaluation and the dice loss in training.

With the proposed training objective, we observe significant performance boosts over a wide range of data imbalanced NLP tasks. Notably, we are able to achieve SOTA results on CTB5, CTB6 and UD1.4 for the part of speech tagging task, and competitive or even better results on CoNLL03, OntoNotes5.0, MSRA and OntoNotes4.0 for the named entity recognition task along with the machine reading comprehension and paraphrase identification tasks.

# 1 Introduction

Data imbalance is a common issue in a variety of NLP tasks such as tagging and machine reading comprehension. Table 1 gives concrete examples: for the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task (Sang and De Meulder, 2003; Nadeau and Sekine, 2007), most tokens are backgrounds with tagging class $O$ . Specifically, the number of tokens with tagging class $O$ is 5 times as many as those with entity labels for the CoNLL03 dataset and 8 times for the OntoNotes5.0 dataset; Dataimbalanced issue is more severe for MRC tasks (Rajpurkar et al., 2016; Nguyen et al., 2016; Rajpurkar et al., 2018; Kocisk ˇ y et al. \` , 2018; Dasigi et al., 2019) with the value of negative-positive ratio being 50-200, which is due to the reason that the task of MRC is usually formalized as predicting the starting and ending indexes conditioned on the query and the context, and given a chunk of text of an arbitrary length, only two tokens are positive (or of interest) with all the rest being background.

Data imbalance results in the following"

### Initial LLM Response

The ratio of negative to positive examples for the **QUOREF** task is **169**.

This figure is explicitly reported in **Table 1** of the provided source material, which summarizes data imbalance statistics across several NLP tasks. For QUOREF (Dasigi et al., 2019), the table lists:
- **6.52 million** negative examples,
- **38.6 thousand** positive examples,
- yielding a **negative-to-positive ratio of 169**.

This extremely high ratio underscores the severe class imbalance inherent in machine reading comprehension (MRC) tasks like QUOREF, where only a tiny fraction of tokens correspond to answer spans (positive examples), and the vast majority are non-answer (negative) tokens.

### Multimodal Processing (1 images)

**Image**: examples/example_working/images/image_1.jpg
**Response**: ### Table Analysis

The provided table, labeled as "Table 1: Number of positive and negative examples and their ratios for different data-imbalanced NLP tasks," contains detailed statistics for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The relevant row for the **QUOREF** task is:

- **Task**: QUOREF (Dasigi et al., 2019)
- **# neg**: 6.52M
- **# pos**: 38.6K
- **ratio**: **169**

This ratio indicates that for every positive example in the QUOREF dataset, there are approximately 169 negative examples, highlighting an extreme level of class imbalance.

### Image Analysis

The image referenced (`IMAGE_1`) is a visual representation of the same table described above. It explicitly displays the **ratio column**, where the value **169** is listed under the QUOREF task. This confirms the numerical data extracted from the table and reinforces the severity of data imbalance in this task.

### Integrated Insights

The ratio of negative to positive examples for the **QUOREF** task is **169**, as directly reported in both the tabular data and the associated image. This high ratio reflects the nature of machine reading comprehension (MRC) tasks, where only a small number of tokens (e.g., start/end of answer spans) are labeled as positive, while the vast majority are background (negative). Such extreme imbalance poses significant challenges for model training, particularly when using standard loss functions like cross-entropy, which may prioritize accuracy over precision and recall on minority classes.

Thus, the answer to the query is:
> The ratio of negative to positive examples for the QUOREF task is **169**.

### Merged Multimodal Response

The ratio of negative to positive examples for the QUOREF task is **169**. This means that for every positive example in the dataset, there are approximately 169 negative examples, reflecting a significant class imbalance typical of machine reading comprehension tasks.

### Final Response

The ratio of negative to positive examples for the QUOREF task is **169**. This means that for every positive example in the dataset, there are approximately 169 negative examples.

This figure is explicitly reported in **Table 1** of the source material, which provides data imbalance statistics across several NLP tasks. Specifically, for QUOREF (Dasigi et al., 2019), the dataset contains:
- **6.52 million** negative examples,
- **38.6 thousand** positive examples,

which yields a **negative-to-positive ratio of 169**. This extreme imbalance is typical in machine reading comprehension tasks, where only a small fraction of tokens correspond to answer spans (positive examples), and the vast majority are non-answer (negative) tokens.

This weighting scheme assigns higher importance to minority-class samples to counteract data imbalance.",3
1,"IMAGE_3","ORI_IMG",""The image displays a mathematical equation labeled as 'CE' (Cross-Entropy), which is commonly used in machine learning for classification tasks, particularly in the context of multi-class or binary classification with probabilistic outputs. The equation is written in LaTeX-style mathematical notation and reads: \[ \mathrm{CE} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i} \alpha_i \sum_{j \in \{0,1\}} y_{ij} \log p_{ij} \]This formula represents a weighted cross-entropy loss function. Here, \( N \) denotes the total number of samples in the dataset. The outer summation is over individual samples \( i \), and each sample contributes to the loss scaled by a weight factor \( \alpha_i \), where \( \alpha_i \in [0,1] \). This weighting allows for adjusting the importance of different samples, typically to address class imbalance. The inner summation is over the possible class labels \( j \in \{0,1\} \), indicating a binary classification setting. For each sample \( i \) and class \( j \), \( y_{ij} \) is the true label (usually 0 or 1 in one-hot encoding), and \( p_{ij} \) is the predicted probability assigned by the model to class \( j \) for sample \( i \). The logarithmic term \( \log p_{ij} \) penalizes low-confidence correct predictions more heavily. The negative sign ensures that minimizing the CE loss corresponds to maximizing the likelihood of correct predictions. The context provided explains that this formulation allows for unequal treatment of samples via \( \alpha_i \), which can be set based on inverse class frequency or tuned via hyperparameters such as \( K \) in the expression \( \log \left( \frac{n - n_t}{n_t} + K \right) \), where \( n_t \) is the count of samples in class \( t \) and \( n \) is the total number of training samples.

### Initial LLM Response

The data indicates that the coefficient alpha ($\alpha_i$) for the Weighted Cross-Entropy Loss is primarily calculated to address data imbalance by assigning higher importance to minority-class samples.

Specifically, the calculation methods proposed are:

1.  **Inverse Frequency of the Sample's Class**: This is a common approach where $\alpha_i$ is determined based on how frequently a class appears in the dataset.
2.  **Specific Formula**: A more detailed formula is provided:
    $\alpha_i = \log(\frac{n - n_t}{n_t} + K)$
    Where:
    *   $n$ is the total number of samples.
    *   $n_t$ is the count of samples belonging to class $t$.
    *   $K$ is a tunable hyperparameter.

This weighting scheme ensures that minority classes receive higher weights, thereby reducing the influence of majority classes and mitigating bias in imbalanced datasets. The value of $\alpha_i$ typically falls within the range $[0, 1]$.

### Multimodal Processing (2 images)

**Image**: examples/example_working/images/image_3.jpg
**Response**: The coefficient $\alpha_i$ for the Weighted Cross-Entropy Loss is proposed to be calculated in the following ways, as described in the provided information:

1.  **Inverse Frequency of the Sample's Class**: It is often calculated using the inverse frequency of the sample’s class. This approach assigns higher importance to minority-class samples to counteract data imbalance.
2.  **Specific Formula with Hyperparameter K**: A common formula for its calculation is $\log(\frac{n - n_t}{n_t} + K)$.
    *   Here, $n_t$ represents the count of samples belonging to class $t$.
    *   $n$ is the total number of samples in the dataset.
    *   $K$ is a tunable hyperparameter, which allows for further adjustment of the weighting scheme.

This weighting scheme allows for adjusting the importance of different samples, particularly to address class imbalance by reducing the influence of majority classes and increasing that of minority classes.

**Data Sources Used:**
*   **Entity 0 ("Sample Weight Coefficient ($\alpha_i$)"):** Directly defines $\alpha_i$ and provides its calculation methods.

*   **Entity 3 ("Weighted Cross-Entropy Loss (WCE)"):** Reinforces the calculation methods for $\alpha_i$ in the context of WCE.

**Image**: examples/example_working/images/image_2.jpg
**Response**: The paper proposes that the coefficient alpha ($\alpha_i$) for the Weighted Cross-Entropy Loss is calculated using the inverse frequency of the sample's class.

Specifically, the calculation is given by the formula:
$\alpha_i = \log(\frac{n - n_t}{n_t} + K)$

Where:
*   $n_t$ is the count of samples belonging to class $t$.
*   $n$ is the total number of samples.
*   $K$ is a tunable hyperparameter.

This weighting scheme assigns higher importance to samples from minority classes to counteract data imbalance, thus modulating their contribution to the overall loss.

1.  **Inverse Frequency of the Sample's Class**: The coefficient is generally calculated using the inverse frequency of the sample's class. This method is designed to assign higher importance to samples from minority classes, thereby counteracting data imbalance.
2.  **Specific Formula with Hyperparameter K**: A more specific formulation for $\alpha_i$ is given by:
    $$\alpha_i = \log\left(\frac{n - n_t}{n_t} + K\right)$$
    Where:
    *   $n_t$ represents the count of samples belonging to class $t$.
    *   $n$ is the total number of samples in the dataset.
    *   $K$ is a tunable hyperparameter that allows for further adjustment of the weighting scheme.

This weighting scheme modulates the contribution of different samples to the overall loss, particularly by reducing the influence of majority classes and increasing that of minority classes to address class imbalance.

**Data Sources Used:**
*   **Entity 0 ("Sample Weight Coefficient ($\alpha_i$)"):** Directly defines $\alpha_i$ and provides its calculation methods.
*   **Entity 1 ("IMAGE_3" description):** Explains the context of the weighted cross-entropy formula shown in the image and details how $\alpha_i$ can be calculated.
*   **Entity 3 ("Weighted Cross-Entropy Loss (WCE)"):** Reinforces the calculation methods for $\alpha_i$ in the context of WCE.

### Final Response

The paper proposes two interconnected ways to calculate the coefficient $\alpha_i$ for the Weighted Cross-Entropy Loss:

1.  **Inverse Frequency of the Sample's Class**: The coefficient is generally calculated using the inverse frequency of the sample's class. This method is designed to assign higher importance to samples from minority classes, thereby counteracting data imbalance.
2.  **Specific Formula with Hyperparameter K**: A more specific formulation for $\alpha_i$ is given by:
    $$\alpha_i = \log\left(\frac{n - n_t}{n_t} + K\right)$$
    Where:
    *   $n_t$ represents the count of samples belonging to class $t$.
    *   $n$ is the total number of samples in the dataset.
    *   $K$ is a tunable hyperparameter that allows for further adjustment of the weighting scheme.

This weighting scheme modulates the contribution of different samples to the overall loss, particularly by reducing the influence of majority classes and increasing that of minority classes to address class imbalance.

It is often calculated using the inverse frequency of the sample’s class (e.g., $\log(\frac{n - n_t}{n_t} + K)$, where $n_t$ is the count of class $t$, $n$ is the total number of samples, and $K$ is a tunable hyperparameter). This weighting scheme assigns higher importance to minority-class samples to counteract data imbalance.",3
1,"IMAGE_3","ORI_IMG",""The image displays a mathematical equation labeled as 'CE' (Cross-Entropy), which is commonly used in machine learning for classification tasks, particularly in the context of multi-class or binary classification with probabilistic outputs. The equation is written in LaTeX-style mathematical notation and reads: \[ \mathrm{CE} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i} \alpha_i \sum_{j \in \{0,1\}} y_{ij} \log p_{ij} \]This formula represents a weighted cross-entropy loss function. Here, \( N \) denotes the total number of samples in the dataset. The outer summation is over individual samples \( i \), and each sample contributes to the loss scaled by a weight factor \( \alpha_i \), where \( \alpha_i \in [0,1] \). This weighting allows for adjusting the importance of different samples, typically to address class imbalance. The inner summation is over the possible class labels \( j \in \{0,1\} \), indicating a binary classification setting. For each sample \( i \) and class \( j \), \( y_{ij} \) is the true label (usually 0 or 1 in one-hot encoding), and \( p_{ij} \) is the predicted probability assigned by the model to class \( j \) for sample \( i \). The logarithmic term \( \log p_{ij} \) penalizes low-confidence correct predictions more heavily. The negative sign ensures that minimizing the CE loss corresponds to maximizing the likelihood of correct predictions. The context provided explains that this formulation allows for unequal treatment of samples via \( \alpha_i \), which can be set based on inverse class frequency or tuned via hyperparameters such as \( K \) in the expression \( \log \left( \frac{n - n_t}{n_t} + K \right) \), where \( n_t \) is the count of samples in class \( t \) and \( n \) is the total number of training samples. This adjustment reduces the influence of majority classes and increases that of minority classes, helping mitigate bias in imbalanced datasets."",9

This is particularly useful in imbalanced datasets, where minority classes are assigned higher weights—often computed using inverse class frequency or formulas like log((n − n_t)/n_t + K), where n_t is the count of class t and n is the total number of samples. While effective, improper weighting can bias the model toward rare classes.",4
4,"IMAGE_2","ORI_IMG",""The image displays a mathematical formula representing the cross-entropy (CE) loss function used in binary classification tasks. The formula is written in LaTeX-style notation and reads: CE = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i} \sum_{j \in \{0,1\}} y_{ij} \log p_{ij}. This equation computes the average cross-entropy loss over N training instances. For each instance i, the sum is taken over the two possible class labels j ∈ {0,1}, where y_ij represents the true label (either 0 or 1) and p_ij denotes the predicted probability for class j. The logarithm of the predicted probability is weighted by the true label, ensuring that only the log-probability of the correct class contributes to the loss. The negative sign ensures the loss is positive, and dividing by N normalizes the total loss across all samples. The context explains that this formulation applies to binary classification with one-hot encoded labels and can be extended to multi-class settings. It also mentions that each training instance contributes equally to the final objective, and strategies like class weighting or resampling are used when unequal treatment of instances is desired."",10

### Initial LLM Response

The paper proposes two primary methods for calculating the sample weight coefficient ($\alpha_i$) for the Weighted Cross-Entropy Loss (WCE):

1.  **Inverse Frequency of the Sample's Class**: The $\alpha_i$ coefficient can be determined based on the inverse frequency of the class to which the $i$-th sample belongs. This approach assigns higher importance to samples from minority classes to counteract data imbalance.
2.  **Specific Formula with Hyperparameter K**: A more detailed calculation involves the formula:
    $$ \alpha_i = \log \left( \frac{n - n_t}{n_t} + K \right) $$
    Where:
    *   $n_t$ represents the count of samples belonging to class $t$ (the class of the $i$-th sample).
    *   $n$ is the total number of samples in the dataset.
    *   $K$ is a tunable hyperparameter that can be adjusted to fine-tune the weighting.

This weighting scheme, whether using inverse class frequency directly or the specified logarithmic formula, aims to reduce the influence of majority classes and increase that of minority classes, thereby mitigating bias in imbalanced datasets.

### Multimodal Processing (2 images)

**Image**: examples/example_working/images/image_2.jpg
**Response**: The provided image displays the formula for standard Cross-Entropy (CE) loss, which does not include the coefficient alpha (α_i). Therefore, the image is not directly relevant to how alpha is calculated for Weighted Cross-Entropy Loss.

Based on the provided entities, the paper proposes to calculate the coefficient alpha (α_i) for the Weighted Cross-Entropy Loss using the following methods:

1.  **Inverse Class Frequency**: The coefficient α_i is often calculated based on the inverse frequency of the sample's class. This approach assigns higher importance to minority-class samples to counteract data imbalance, thereby reducing the influence of majority classes and increasing that of minority classes.
2.  **Specific Formula**: A common formulation for α_i involves a logarithmic expression:
    $\alpha_i = \log(\frac{n - n_t}{n_t} + K)$
    Where:
    *   $n_t$ is the count of samples belonging to class $t$.
    *   $n$ is the total number of samples.
    *   $K$ is a tunable hyperparameter.

This formula is a specific way to implement inverse class frequency weighting, and it allows for tuning the weighting effect through the hyperparameter $K$. The purpose of this weighting is to adjust the contribution of each instance during training, particularly in imbalanced datasets, where minority classes are assigned higher weights.

**Image**: examples/example_working/images/image_3.jpg
**Response**: The paper proposes to calculate the sample weight coefficient ($\alpha_i$) for the Weighted Cross-Entropy Loss primarily through two methods:

1.  **Inverse Class Frequency:** The coefficient $\alpha_i$ is often determined using the inverse frequency of the class to which the i-th sample belongs. This approach assigns higher importance to samples from minority classes to counteract data imbalance.
2.  **Tunable Hyperparameter Formula:** A specific formula provided for calculating $\alpha_i$ is:
    $\log(\frac{n - n_t}{n_t} + K)$
    where:
    *   $n_t$ is the count of samples belonging to class $t$.
    *   $n$ is the total number of samples in the dataset.
    *   $K$ is a tunable hyperparameter.

This weighting scheme ensures that samples from under-represented classes contribute more significantly to the total loss, helping to mitigate bias in imbalanced datasets.

**Data Sources Used:**
*   **Entity 0: "Sample Weight Coefficient (α_i)"**: Directly describes the calculation methods.
*   **Entity 1: "IMAGE_3"**: The description of this image (which shows the Weighted Cross-Entropy formula) explicitly mentions the calculation of $\alpha_i$ based on inverse class frequency and the formula with hyperparameter $K$.
*   **Entity 3: "Weighted Cross-Entropy Loss (WCE)"**: Reaffirms the use of inverse class frequency and the formula for $\alpha_i$ in the context of imbalanced datasets.
